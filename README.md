* Image captioning is a challenging task at the intersection of vision and language. Here, we demonstrate using Keras and eager execution to incorporate an attention mechanism that allows the network to concentrate on image features relevant to the current state of text generation.

* In image captioning, an algorithm is given an image and tasked with producing a sensible caption. This is why recent deep learning approaches mostly include some “attention” mechanism (sometimes even more than one) to help focusing on relevant image features.

* In this project, we demonstrate a formulation of image captioning as an encoder-decoder problem, enhanced by spatial attention over image grid cells.
* The Dataset used here is by MS_COCO
